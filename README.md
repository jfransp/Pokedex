### Progress View
Custom view developed by [skydoves](https://github.com/skydoves) (from whom I also got inspiration for the detail screen layout).

##   

### Some minor implementations
##### Recycler Views, Bottom Navigation, Swipe to Delete (with undo snackbar), Database Type Converters for Room, LiveData



# PokeAPI
This app was developed on top of the [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/) free to use pokemon data REST Api.

# Architecture
Basic MVVM architecture with repository. Remote mediation for detail screen was handled within the viewmodel itself; dependencies were injected with Hilt; each fragment has
it's own viewmodel and some navigation dependent logic was implemented on the MainActivity itself.

There's still room for improvement as always but it works (:

##     

##### Future improvements
Handling no network response on main pokedex screen (some message, retry button, etc); for now it just stays blank in case of no internet connection. Adding loadstate listeners for fragments with circular progressbar. Adding comments on code for clarity and educational purposes.

###### App developed for the VentureLabs selective process code challenge.
